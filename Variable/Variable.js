let a=20;//we can assign a new value to the a in furture
var b=20;//it is before es6 was introduced
const c=30;//when we use const we cannot change the value of c 

//example one of let
 a=50;// assigning a new value to a
console.log(a)//output =50;

 b=30;//same as let
console.log(b)//output =50;
 
c=40;//assigning a new value to c as 40
console.log(c)//render a error msg
